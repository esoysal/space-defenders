SPACE DEFENDERS by Ekin Soysal

Space Defenders is an arcade game. You need to defend your planet by destroying waves of enemy spaceship attacks. There are three types of enemy spaceships, each with different durability. I edited the code so that the harder types of enemies would appear quicker, in order that all the objects would be seen in the game without having to play it for a long time. If an enemy spaceship reaches or passes the player, the player loses the game. Also, there are boosts that the enemy sometimes drops which gives the player a special type of ammo. Unlike the normal ammo, this ammo does not disappear or get destroyed after hitting an enemy, it destroys every enemy in its path.

To run, extract all the files into the same folder, then click run.bat. It requires Java 1.5 or above, and Java interpreter on the path. 

Also, compelete source code can be found in CSProject.java file. Details are explained there as comments.
